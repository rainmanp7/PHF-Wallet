Make sure you have the following installed.

 First step? = Install the required files.

 gcc7 and basic
 boost 1.55
 Qt5
 qrencode or qren
 cmake 3.10

 Next Step
 cmake cmakelists.txt
 then make -j3

Current = TEST PHASE 1.
Current issue is the final executable. permission issues on build cause the final to become a bit difficult to understand.
Possibly a fix will be in order. It does come up and things seem viewable. Operational parts will be tested and reviewed for working capabilities.

 The current build will fail at the end becasue of wrapper ?
 then allot of errors are thrown about things undefined.
